from visualization import create_gui

def main():
    create_gui()

    '''
After calling the create_gui function, importing a model and proccessing it we'll have global values:
mazeUrl, mazePcd, originalMaze, depth_axis, wall_points 
that we can get and use by calling: globals.mazePcd ... here in the main function
the "globals" file defines global parameters for easier further implementation.
wall_points is the most important parameter that contains the points that represent the walls.
if wall_pcd is needed then we can simply call:
        walls_pcd = o3d.geometry.PointCloud()
        walls_pcd.points = o3d.utility.Vector3dVector(walls_points)
