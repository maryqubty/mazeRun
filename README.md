# Maze Path Navigator with Drone and Car Guidance

This project demonstrates a multi-level system combining drone-based maze analysis and car navigation. Below is a detailed explanation of each phase, along with visual results from various mazes.

---

### **First Level: Path Analysis**
In this phase, the system extracts 3D point cloud data from COLMAP models and analyzes point depth to distinguish open paths from walls.

**Key Achievements:**
- Analyzed and processed 3D COLMAP models.
- Identified open paths and walls for any 3D maze.

### **Second Level: 2D Grid Conversion and Pathfinding**
The second level focuses on converting 3D models into 2D grids and calculating the shortest path between manually selected start and end points.

**Key Features:**
- Created a 2D grid where open paths are represented by `0` and walls by `1`.
- Enabled user input for selecting start and exit points.
- Implemented the A* algorithm to compute static (non-real-time) shortest paths.

### **Final Level: Real-Time Navigation**
The ultimate goal is to enable real-time communication between the drone and the car, optimizing the navigation process further.

**Planned Enhancements:**
- Enable real-time shortest-path directions from drone to car.
- Integrate path optimization algorithms for real-world implementation.
